## 2. Pre-Payment / Part-Payment Charges

Pre-payment refers to paying a lump-sum amount over and above the regular EMI to reduce the outstanding principal balance. This can result in either a reduction in EMI amount or a reduction in the remaining tenure, depending on the borrower's preference and product terms.

### 2.1 Floating Rate Loans — Individual Borrowers

As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular dated 12 May 2014 (RBI/2013-14/583), **no pre-payment penalty is applicable for floating-rate loans** availed by individual borrowers. This applies to all Tata Capital loan products where the interest rate is floating and the borrower is an individual.

### 2.2 Fixed Rate Loans

| Product | Pre-Payment Charge | Conditions |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Personal Loan (Fixed) | Up to 4% of the outstanding principal at the time of pre-payment + 18% GST | Permitted after lock-in period of 6 EMIs |
| Business Loan (Fixed) | Up to 4% of the outstanding principal + 18% GST | Permitted after lock-in period of 12 EMIs |

### 2.3 Part-Payment Rules

- **Minimum part-payment amount**: ₹10,000 or the equivalent of 1 EMI, whichever is higher.
- **Maximum part-payments per year**: Typically limited to 2–4 instances per financial year (product-specific). Refer to your loan agreement for the exact limit.
- **Lock-in period**: Part-payment is generally permitted only after the completion of the lock-in period specified in the loan agreement (typically 6–12 EMIs).
- **Application**: The borrower must submit a written request (or raise a request via the portal/app) for part-payment. The adjustment (EMI reduction or tenure reduction) will be applied from the next EMI cycle.

## 3. Foreclosure Charges

Foreclosure refers to the complete repayment and closure of the loan before the scheduled tenure ends.

### 3.1 Floating Rate Loans — Individual Borrowers

### 3.2 Fixed Rate Loans & Non-Individual Borrowers

## 4. Late Payment / Penal Charges

Timely EMI payment is critical to maintaining a healthy credit profile. The following charges apply in case of payment default:

### 4.1 Penal Interest

| Event | Charge |
|-------|--------|
| Overdue EMI (delay beyond the due date) | Up to **2% per month** (24% per annum) on the overdue EMI amount, calculated from the due date until the date of actual payment |

|-------|--------|
| NACH / ECS / Cheque bounce (each instance) | **₹500 per instance** + 18% GST |

- **NPA classification**: If 3 or more consecutive EMIs are missed (90+ days past due), the account may be classified as a **Non-Performing Asset (NPA)** as per RBI norms.
- **Recovery action**: Upon NPA classification, Tata Capital may initiate recovery proceedings, which may include:
  - Engagement of authorised recovery agents
  - Legal notices and proceedings
  - For secured loans: Action under the **Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002**, which may include seizure and auction of the secured property

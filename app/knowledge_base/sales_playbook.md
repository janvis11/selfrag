*Last updated: February 2026 | Version 4.0 | Classification: Internal — Sales & Customer-Facing*
*For use by: Relationship Managers, Sales Executives, Customer Care Agents, Chatbot Systems*

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This Sales Playbook provides standardised, compliant responses to common customer objections and frequently raised concerns during the loan origination and sales process. All responses are designed to be:

- **Factually accurate** and aligned with Tata Capital's approved product terms
- **Compliant** with RBI Fair Practices Code and IRDAI guidelines
- **Empathetic** and customer-centric
- **Non-committal** on approval, rates, or terms that are subject to individual underwriting

> **Critical Rule**: Sales personnel and automated systems must **never promise loan approval, specific interest rates, or waiver of charges** unless explicitly authorised by the appropriate sanctioning authority. All terms are subject to individual credit assessment.

---

## 2. Interest Rate & Pricing Objections

### 2.1 "Your interest rate is too high."

**Recommended Response:**

"I understand your concern about the interest rate, and I appreciate you bringing it up. Our interest rates are determined through a comprehensive assessment of multiple factors, including your credit profile, income stability, loan amount, tenure, and prevailing market conditions.

The rate offered to you is personalised — it reflects the risk assessment specific to your profile. Many of our customers find that when they consider the complete picture — including our transparent fee structure, no hidden charges, flexible prepayment options (with no foreclosure penalty on floating-rate loans for individuals as per RBI norms), and dedicated customer support — the overall value is very competitive.

I'd be happy to walk you through a detailed breakup of the total cost of borrowing so you can make an informed comparison. Would you also like me to explore if there are any ongoing offers or schemes that might be applicable to your profile?"

**Do's:**
- Emphasise personalised, risk-based pricing
- Highlight value-adds beyond just the rate (transparency, flexibility, service)
- Offer to share the MITC for a complete fee breakup
- Check for any applicable ongoing promotional schemes

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Promise a rate reduction without authority
- ❌ Quote hypothetical rates that may not apply to the customer
- ❌ Disparage competitor products or rates

---

### 2.2 "Another bank/NBFC is offering me a lower rate."

**Recommended Response:**

"That's great that you're doing your due diligence and comparing options — I'd encourage every borrower to do so. Alongside the interest rate, I'd recommend comparing a few other important factors that significantly impact your total cost of borrowing:

1. **Processing fees**: Some lenders charge up to 3–4% in processing fees, which adds substantially to the upfront cost.
2. **Prepayment and foreclosure charges**: Tata Capital charges zero foreclosure penalty on floating-rate individual loans, as per RBI norms. Not all lenders may offer this flexibility on all products.
3. **Hidden charges**: Look for charges like documentation fees, login fees, or administrative charges that may not be obvious upfront. At Tata Capital, all charges are transparently disclosed in the MITC.
4. **Service quality**: Tata Capital offers dedicated relationship management, digital servicing through our app and portal, and a well-structured grievance redressal mechanism.
5. **Disbursement speed**: Our processing timelines are among the fastest in the industry for personal and business loans.
6. **Flexibility**: We offer part-payment options, balance transfer-in facilities, and tenure restructuring possibilities.

The 'lowest rate' advertisement may not always translate to the lowest total cost. I'd be happy to help you compare on a total-cost basis if you'd like."

**Do's:**
- Acknowledge the customer's right to compare
- Shift the conversation from rate to total cost of borrowing
- Highlight Tata Capital's unique value propositions
- Offer to do a side-by-side comparison on total cost

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Criticise or disparage competitors by name
- ❌ Make false claims about competitor products
- ❌ Match or promise to beat competitor rates without authorisation

---

### 2.3 "Can you reduce the rate for me?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I appreciate you asking. The rate offered is based on a standardised assessment of your credit profile, and I'm not able to modify it unilaterally. However, there are a few things we can explore:

1. If you have a strong credit score (750+), we can check if you're eligible for a preferential rate slab.
2. If you're an existing Tata Capital customer or a Tata Group employee, there may be relationship-based pricing benefits.
3. If there are any ongoing promotional offers or tie-ups with your employer, those might apply.
4. You could also consider applying with a co-applicant who has a strong credit profile, which may improve the overall assessment and potentially the rate offered.

Let me check what options are available for your specific case."

**Do's:**
- Acknowledge the request respectfully
- Explore legitimate avenues for rate improvement
- Be transparent about the process

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Promise rate reduction without checking with the credit/sanctioning team
- ❌ Offer unofficial discounts or verbal commitments

---

## 3. Documentation & Privacy Concerns

### 3.1 "Why do you need so many documents?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I completely understand — the documentation process can feel extensive. Here's why each category of documents is important:

1. **Identity & Address Proof (PAN, Aadhaar)**: These are mandatory under RBI's Know Your Customer (KYC) norms. Every financial institution in India is required to verify the identity of its customers to prevent fraud, money laundering, and identity theft.

2. **Income Proof (Salary Slips, ITR, Bank Statements)**: This allows us to assess your repayment capacity and ensure that the loan EMI is comfortable for you. It's a responsible lending practice — we want to make sure you can repay without financial stress.

3. **Employment / Business Proof**: Verification of stable income and employment or business continuity.

4. **Property Documents (for secured loans)**: If you're applying for a Home Loan or Loan Against Property, we need to verify the legal title and value of the property being offered as security. This protects both you and us.

Our goal is to process your application as quickly as possible while ensuring all regulatory requirements are met. If any specific document is difficult for you to arrange, let me know — I can check if we have alternative options or if we can proceed with a conditional approval while you arrange the remaining documents."

**Do's:**
- Explain the purpose behind each document category
- Reference regulatory requirements (RBI KYC)
- Offer to help find alternatives for difficult-to-arrange documents
- Be patient and empathetic

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Pressure the customer to provide documents they're uncomfortable sharing
- ❌ Accept or process documents that appear forged or tampered
- ❌ Skip mandatory KYC documents under any circumstances

---

### 3.2 "I'm worried about my data privacy. How safe is my information?"

**Recommended Response:**

"Your concern about data privacy is entirely valid, and I want to assure you that data protection is a top priority at Tata Capital. Here is how we safeguard your information:

1. **Encryption**: All personal and financial data is encrypted both at rest and during transmission using industry-standard encryption protocols (AES-256, TLS 1.2+).

2. **Access Controls**: Only authorised personnel with a legitimate business need can access your data. We use role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication internally.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Our data handling practices comply with:
   - RBI KYC/AML Directions
   - Information Technology Act, 2000
   - Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023
   - All applicable data privacy regulations

4. **No Selling of Data**: Your personal information is **never sold** to unrelated third parties for marketing purposes. Data is shared only with authorised verification agencies, credit bureaus (as mandated by RBI), and our empanelled service partners — strictly for the purpose of processing and servicing your loan.

5. **Data Minimisation**: We collect only the data that is necessary for loan processing and regulatory compliance.

6. **Your Rights**: Under DPDPA 2023, you have the right to access, correct, and seek erasure of your data. You can also withdraw consent for non-essential processing at any time.

For the complete details, our Privacy Policy is available on the Tata Capital website. If you'd like, I can share the link with you."

**Do's:**
- Reassure with specific security measures
- Reference applicable regulations
- Offer the privacy policy document
- Be transparent and thorough

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Dismiss privacy concerns as trivial
- ❌ Make guarantees about absolute security (no system is 100% breach-proof)
- ❌ Share details about internal security architecture beyond what's appropriate

---

### 3.3 "Why do you need my Aadhaar?"

**Recommended Response:**

"Aadhaar is used for electronic KYC (e-KYC) verification, which is one of the methods prescribed by RBI for customer identity verification. Using Aadhaar-based e-KYC significantly speeds up the verification process and can reduce your loan processing time.

However, I want to clarify a few important points:

1. Aadhaar is **not mandatory** for a loan application. You can use alternative identity documents like a Passport, Voter ID, or Driving Licence.
2. If you choose to provide Aadhaar for e-KYC, your explicit consent is required and obtained before any verification is initiated.
3. We comply with the Supreme Court of India's Aadhaar judgement (K.S. Puttaswamy case) — your Aadhaar data is used strictly for identity verification and is not stored in its raw form beyond the verification process.
4. Only the last 4 digits of your Aadhaar number are displayed in our systems for reference; the full number is masked.

If you'd prefer not to use Aadhaar, we can proceed with alternative KYC documents. Would you like to explore that option?"

---

## 4. Fee-Related Objections

### 4.1 "Why is there a processing fee? Can it be waived?"

**Recommended Response:**

"The processing fee covers the operational costs involved in evaluating your loan application. This includes:

- Credit bureau checks (CIBIL/Experian score pull)
- Document verification and validation
- Employment and address verification
- Credit underwriting and risk assessment
- For secured loans: Property valuation and legal title verification

It is a standard practice across the lending industry, and the fee is transparently disclosed upfront before you confirm your application.

Regarding waiver — processing fees are part of our standard pricing. However, during specific promotional periods, Tata Capital may offer reduced or waived processing fees on select products. I can check if any such offer is currently active for your product and profile.

I want to assure you that what you see in the MITC is what you pay — there are no hidden charges beyond what is disclosed."

---

### 4.2 "What if I don't get approved — do I still pay the processing fee?"

**Recommended Response:**

"That's an important question. The processing fee is charged for evaluating and processing your application — it covers the cost of work that is done regardless of the outcome (credit checks, verification, underwriting). Therefore, the processing fee is generally non-refundable once the application has been processed.

However, I want to set expectations clearly:

1. Before collecting the processing fee, we perform a preliminary assessment of your eligibility. We do not encourage applications that are unlikely to be approved.
2. If you decide to cancel your application before processing begins, the processing fee may be refundable (subject to Tata Capital's policies at that time).
3. If the loan is sanctioned but you choose not to proceed, the processing fee is non-refundable as the evaluation has already been completed.

Our goal is to be transparent upfront so there are no surprises."

---

## 5. Loan Approval & Eligibility Objections

### 5.1 "Can you guarantee my loan will be approved?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I appreciate your eagerness, and I want to be completely honest with you — **no lender can guarantee loan approval** prior to completing the full credit assessment. The approval decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of:

- Your credit score and credit history
- Income and repayment capacity
- Existing financial obligations (FOIR calculation)
- Employment or business stability
- For secured loans: Property value and legal clarity

What I **can** tell you is that based on the preliminary information you've shared, your profile looks [encouraging/in line with general eligibility criteria]. I'll make sure your application gets the most thorough and fair assessment possible.

If the application doesn't meet the criteria for the amount you've requested, we may still be able to offer a lower amount or suggest alternatives to strengthen your application (such as adding a co-applicant)."

**Do's:**
- Be honest that approval is not guaranteed
- Provide a preliminary positive indication if genuinely applicable
- Suggest ways to improve chances (co-applicant, higher income proof)

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ NEVER promise or guarantee approval
- ❌ NEVER say "your loan is approved" before official sanction
- ❌ NEVER suggest falsifying income or documents to meet eligibility

---

### 5.2 "My loan was rejected. Why?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I understand how disappointing this must be, and I empathise with your situation. While I may not be able to share the specific internal reasons for the decision (as underwriting criteria are confidential), there are some common factors that can affect a loan application:

1. **Credit score below the threshold**: A score below 650 significantly reduces approval chances.
2. **High existing obligations**: If your existing EMIs take up more than 50–60% of your net income (high FOIR), additional lending becomes risky for both you and us.
3. **Incomplete or inconsistent documentation**: Mismatches between declared income and bank statement credits, for example.
4. **Short employment / business vintage**: Applicants with very recent employment changes or new businesses may need more time to build stability.
5. **Adverse credit history**: Past defaults, write-offs, or settlements in the credit bureau record.

**What you can do next:**

1. **Check your credit report**: You can obtain a free annual credit report from CIBIL or other CICs. Review it for any errors and dispute them.
2. **Build your credit score**: Make timely payments on existing obligations and avoid over-utilising credit limits.
3. **Reapply after 6 months**: Credit profiles can improve over time. You may reapply after addressing the factors that may have caused the decline.
4. **Explore alternatives**: A secured loan (Loan Against Property) may have different eligibility criteria. Adding a co-applicant with a strong profile may also help.

I'm here to help you explore your options."

## 6. Repayment & EMI Objections

### 6.1 "What if I can't pay my EMIs on time?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I understand that life can be unpredictable, and financial circumstances can change. The most important thing is to communicate with us early if you anticipate difficulty. Here's what you should know:

**If you foresee difficulty:**
1. Contact your relationship manager or customer care as soon as possible — before missing an EMI, if possible.
2. Tata Capital may be able to discuss options such as:
   - Temporary tenure extension to reduce EMI burden
   - Repayment restructuring (subject to assessment and approval)
   - Moratorium in exceptional circumstances (as may be permitted by RBI from time to time)

**If you miss an EMI:**
1. A penal interest of up to 2% per month is charged on the overdue EMI amount.
2. A bounce charge of ₹500 + GST per instance applies if the NACH/cheque is dishonoured.
3. The missed EMI is reported to credit bureaus (CIBIL, Experian, etc.), which will impact your credit score.
4. Persistent default (90+ days overdue) may lead to NPA classification and recovery action.

**Our approach:**
- We always prefer an amicable resolution over punitive action.
- Recovery agents, if engaged, operate strictly under RBI guidelines — no harassment, no contact outside of 7 AM to 7 PM.
- If your situation is genuine, we'll work with you to find a workable solution.

The key takeaway: **Don't avoid us — engage with us proactively.**"

### 6.2 "The EMI seems too high. Can you reduce it?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I understand your concern about affordability — we want you to be comfortable with your repayment commitment. There are a few ways we can potentially reduce the EMI:

1. **Extend the tenure**: A longer tenure spreads the repayment over more months, reducing each EMI. However, note that a longer tenure means more total interest paid over the life of the loan.

2. **Reduce the loan amount**: If possible, consider reducing the loan amount by arranging a larger down payment (for asset purchases) or borrowing a slightly lower amount.

3. **Add a co-applicant**: Adding a co-applicant with income can increase the eligible loan amount at the current EMI, or reduce the EMI for the same loan amount, as total income is considered.

4. **Step-up EMI option**: For certain products, we offer step-up EMIs where the initial EMIs are lower and increase gradually over time. This is suitable for young professionals whose income is expected to grow.

5. **Part-payment**: If you come into additional funds in the future (bonus, inheritance, etc.), a part-payment can reduce the outstanding principal and thereby the EMI or remaining tenure.

Would you like me to recalculate the EMI with a different tenure or amount to find a comfortable fit?"

---

## 7. Insurance Objections

### 7.1 "I don't want loan insurance. Will it affect my loan?"

**Recommended Response:**

"I want to be absolutely clear on this: **Loan protection insurance is entirely optional and is NOT a condition for loan approval, processing, or disbursement.** Tata Capital fully complies with IRDAI and RBI guidelines on this matter.

That said, I'd like to explain the benefits so you can make an informed decision:

**What Credit Life Insurance covers:**
- In the event of the borrower's death, the outstanding loan amount is paid by the insurer, ensuring your family is not burdened with the repayment.
- Some policies also cover critical illness and permanent disability.
- The premium is a one-time cost, added to the loan amount or paid upfront.

**Features:**
- Single premium, no recurring payments
- Coverage amount equals the outstanding loan principal
- In case of loan foreclosure, the unused premium is refundable on a pro-rata basis (subject to the insurance policy terms)

The decision is completely yours. If you choose not to opt for insurance, your loan application and terms remain exactly the same. Would you like me to continue without insurance?"

**Do's:**
- State clearly that insurance is optional
- Explain benefits objectively
- Respect the customer's decision without pressure

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ NEVER bundle insurance as mandatory for loan approval
- ❌ NEVER tell the customer their loan depends on buying insurance
- ❌ NEVER add insurance without explicit consent (mis-selling is a serious compliance violation under IRDAI guidelines)

## 8. General Sales Conversation Guidelines

### 8.1 Compliance Principles (Mandatory)

Every sales interaction — whether in-person, over the phone, or via digital channels — must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Transparency**: All fees, charges, terms, and conditions must be disclosed clearly and upfront. Never hide or downplay any cost.

2. **No Misleading Claims**: Never fabricate rates, offers, waiver approvals, or benefits that do not exist.

3. **No Approval Guarantees**: Never promise or guarantee loan approval before the formal credit assessment is complete.

4. **Disclaimers in Writing**: Any written communication (email, SMS, WhatsApp, letter) must include relevant disclaimers:
   - "Subject to verification and credit assessment"
   - "Final terms may vary based on individual eligibility and applicable policies"

5. **Customer Right to Decline**: The customer always has the right to decline the loan or any add-on product (insurance, services). Respect their decision without coercion.

6. **Escalation of Complex Queries**: If a customer asks about underwriting decisions, rate negotiations, fee waivers, or any topic outside your scope, escalate to your supervisor or the credit team rather than committing on their behalf.

7. **Record Keeping**: Maintain notes of customer interactions, objections raised, and responses provided. This is essential for audit trail and dispute resolution.

### 8.2 Tone & Language Guidelines

- Use a professional, empathetic, and respectful tone at all times.
- Avoid jargon — explain technical terms in simple language when speaking to non-expert customers.
- Listen actively — let the customer express their concern fully before responding.
- Acknowledge the customer's concern before providing your response.
- Never argue with a customer. If they remain unconvinced, offer to escalate or provide supporting documentation.
- Use positive framing: instead of "we can't do X", say "what we can do is Y".

### 8.3 Key Phrases to Always Include

When providing loan-related information, always include one or more of these qualifiers as appropriate:

- "Subject to verification and credit checks"
- "Final terms may vary based on eligibility and applicable policies at the time of application"
- "This is indicative information; please refer to the sanction letter for exact terms"
- "All fees and charges are as per the prevailing schedule, inclusive of applicable GST"
- "Insurance is optional and not a condition for loan approval"

### 8.4 Phrases to NEVER Use

- ❌ "Your loan is guaranteed / approved / confirmed"
- ❌ "I'll get you the lowest rate"
- ❌ "Other company's product is bad"
- ❌ "You have to take insurance"
- ❌ "We can waive all charges" (unless explicitly authorised)
- ❌ "Just sign here, don't worry about the fine print"

## 9. Handling Sensitive Situations

### 9.1 Customer Is Angry or Frustrated

**Approach:**
1. Stay calm and professional. Do not take it personally.
2. Let the customer vent — do not interrupt.
3. Acknowledge their frustration: "I understand your frustration, and I apologise for the inconvenience."
4. Focus on resolution: "Let me see what I can do to help."
5. If you cannot resolve the issue, escalate promptly and inform the customer about the next steps and expected timeline.

### 9.2 Customer Threatens Legal Action

**Approach:**
1. Remain calm and professional.
2. Document the conversation thoroughly.
3. Do not make admissions of fault or liability.
4. Inform the customer of the formal grievance redressal process (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Ombudsman).
5. Escalate immediately to your supervisor and the compliance/legal team.

### 9.3 Suspected Fraud

**Approach:**
1. If you suspect document fraud, identity theft, or application manipulation, do NOT confront the applicant.
2. Complete the interaction professionally.
3. Immediately report your suspicion to the Fraud Prevention team through the internal escalation channel.
4. Document all observations that raised the suspicion.
5. Do NOT process the application further until the Fraud Prevention team provides clearance.

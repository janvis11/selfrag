### 1.2 How does Tata Capital differ from a bank?

Tata Capital operates as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) under RBI regulation. Key differences from banks include:

- **Faster processing**: Being an NBFC, our underwriting and disbursement timelines are often shorter than traditional banks, especially for personal and business loans.
- **Flexible eligibility criteria**: We employ proprietary credit assessment models that may consider a broader set of parameters beyond traditional CIBIL scores.
- **Specialised products**: Our product design is tailored to segments that may be underserved by mainstream banks, including new-to-credit customers and small business owners.
- **Digital-first approach**: Much of our application, documentation, and servicing is available digitally through our web and mobile platforms.

However, unlike banks, Tata Capital does not accept deposits from the public.

## 2. Loan Application Process

### 2.1 How do I apply for a loan?

You can apply for a loan through any of the following channels:

1. **Online Application**: Visit [www.tatacapital.com](https://www.tatacapital.com) and navigate to the relevant product page. Fill in the online application form with your basic details. An executive will contact you to guide you through the remaining process.

2. **Mobile App**: Download the Tata Capital mobile application from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. The app supports end-to-end application submission for select products.

3. **Branch Walk-in**: Visit your nearest Tata Capital branch with the required identity, address, and income documents. Our relationship managers will assist you in completing the application on the spot.

4. **Authorised Channel Partners**: Tata Capital works with a network of Direct Selling Agents (DSAs) and channel partners. You may also apply through an authorised partner in your area.

Regardless of the channel, all applications undergo the same standardised credit assessment and underwriting process.

### 2.2 What happens after I submit my application?

The typical loan processing workflow is as follows:

1. **Application Receipt**: Your application is logged in our system and assigned a unique reference number.
2. **Document Verification**: Our operations team verifies the documents submitted (identity, address, income proofs).
3. **Credit Bureau Check**: We pull your credit report from one or more Credit Information Companies (CICs) such as CIBIL (TransUnion), Experian, CRIF High Mark, or Equifax.
4. **Field Investigation** (for secured loans): For Home Loans and LAP, a field verification of the property and applicant address is conducted.
5. **Technical & Legal Verification** (for secured loans): An empanelled valuer and advocate assess the property's market value, legal title, and encumbrance status.
6. **Underwriting & Sanction**: Based on the above, the credit team arrives at a decision — approve, conditionally approve, or decline.
7. **Sanction Letter Issuance**: If approved, you receive a sanction letter detailing the approved loan amount, interest rate, tenure, EMI, fees, conditions precedent to disbursement, and other terms.
8. **Acceptance & Agreement Execution**: You sign the loan agreement and related documents.
9. **Disbursement**: Upon satisfaction of all conditions, the loan amount is credited to your designated bank account (or to the builder/seller, in case of Home Loans).

### 2.3 How long does the approval process take?

| Product | Typical Approval Timeline |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Personal Loan | 24–72 hours from receipt of all documents |
| Business Loan | 3–7 business days |
| Home Loan | 7–14 business days (includes property verification) |
| Loan Against Property | 7–14 business days (includes property verification) |
| Consumer Durable Loan | Same-day to 24 hours (at point of sale) |
| Education Loan | 5–10 business days |

These timelines are indicative and assume that all submitted documents are complete, legible, and satisfactory. Delays may occur if additional documentation is requested, if the applicant's profile requires enhanced due diligence, or if the property (in secured loans) has complex title history.

### 2.4 Can I track my application status?

Yes. You can track your application status through the following channels:

- **Online Portal**: Log in to the Tata Capital customer portal with your application reference number and registered mobile number.
- **Mobile App**: Real-time status updates are available in the Tata Capital app.
- **SMS/Email Notifications**: Automatic notifications are sent at key milestones (application received, documents verified, approved, disbursed).
- **Customer Care**: Call our toll-free customer care helpline for status enquiries. Have your application reference number ready.

## 3. Interest Rates & EMI

### 3.1 What interest rates does Tata Capital offer?

Interest rates are determined based on multiple factors, including but not limited to:

- **Applicant's credit score** (CIBIL score / bureau score)
- **Income level and stability** (salaried vs. self-employed, employment vintage)
- **Loan amount and tenure** requested
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio** (for secured loans)
- **Relationship with Tata Capital** (existing customers may receive preferential rates)
- **Market conditions** and Tata Capital's prevailing benchmark rates

**Indicative interest rate ranges (per annum):**

| Product | Rate Range (p.a.) | Rate Type |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Personal Loan | 10.99% – 24.00% | Fixed |
| Business Loan | 12.00% – 26.00% | Fixed / Floating |
| Home Loan | 8.50% – 11.50% | Floating (linked to TCRPLR) |
| Loan Against Property | 9.50% – 14.00% | Floating (linked to TCRPLR) |
| Consumer Durable Loan | 0% (subvented) – 18.00% | Fixed |
| Education Loan | 11.00% – 16.00% | Fixed / Floating |

*TCRPLR = Tata Capital Reference Prime Lending Rate*

> **Important**: The rates shown above are illustrative ranges. The actual rate offered to you will be specific to your credit profile and is communicated in the sanction letter. Tata Capital reserves the right to revise rates periodically in accordance with its internal policies and market conditions.

### 3.2 What is EMI and how is it calculated?

EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) is the fixed monthly payment you make towards repayment of the loan. Each EMI consists of two components:

- **Principal component**: The portion that reduces your outstanding loan balance
- **Interest component**: The cost of borrowing for that month

The EMI is calculated using the following formula:

**EMI = [P × R × (1 + R)^N] / [(1 + R)^N − 1]**

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)
- N = Total number of monthly instalments (tenure in months)

**Example:**
For a Personal Loan of ₹5,00,000 at 14% p.a. for 48 months:
- Monthly rate (R) = 14% / 12 = 1.1667%
- EMI ≈ ₹13,665 per month
- Total interest payable ≈ ₹1,55,925
- Total amount payable ≈ ₹6,55,925

You can use the EMI calculator on the Tata Capital website or mobile app to compute your estimated EMI for different loan amounts, rates, and tenures.

### 3.3 Can I change my EMI amount or tenure after disbursement?

Under certain circumstances, Tata Capital may allow:

- **Tenure extension**: If you wish to reduce your monthly EMI burden, a tenure extension may be considered, subject to the maximum permissible tenure for your product and prevailing policies.
- **Step-up / step-down EMI**: Some products may offer structured EMI arrangements where the EMI increases or decreases over time, aligned with expected income growth.
- **Part-payment**: Making a part-payment reduces the outstanding principal, which can result in either a reduced EMI or a shorter tenure, depending on the option you choose.

Any changes to EMI or tenure are subject to approval and may involve administrative charges.

## 4. Loan Tenure

### 4.1 What are the available tenure options?

| Product | Minimum Tenure | Maximum Tenure |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Personal Loan | 12 months | 60 months (5 years) |
| Business Loan | 12 months | 60 months (5 years) |
| Home Loan | 12 months | 360 months (30 years) |
| Loan Against Property | 12 months | 180 months (15 years) |
| Consumer Durable Loan | 3 months | 36 months (3 years) |
| Education Loan | 12 months | 84 months (7 years) |

The actual tenure offered depends on the applicant's age (loan should typically mature before the applicant reaches retirement age for salaried individuals or a specified upper age limit for self-employed), income stability, and product-specific policies.

### 4.2 Does the tenure affect my interest rate?

In general, the interest rate is determined primarily by credit profile and risk assessment, not by tenure alone. However, for certain products, longer tenures may attract a marginally different rate to account for the extended risk exposure. The specific rate-tenure relationship, if any, will be reflected in the sanction letter.

---

## 5. Prepayment, Part-Payment & Foreclosure

### 5.1 Can I repay my loan before the scheduled tenure ends?

Yes. Tata Capital permits both part-payment (paying a lump sum to reduce the outstanding principal) and foreclosure (repaying the entire outstanding amount before tenure end). The specific terms are:

- **Floating-rate loans to individual borrowers**: As per RBI guidelines, no prepayment or foreclosure penalty is applicable.
- **Fixed-rate loans**: Prepayment/foreclosure charges may apply as specified in your loan agreement and the schedule of charges. Typically, this ranges from 2%–5% of the outstanding principal.
- **Lock-in period**: Most products have a minimum lock-in period (typically 6–12 EMIs) before prepayment or foreclosure is permitted.

Refer to your sanction letter and loan agreement for the exact charges and conditions applicable to your loan.

### 5.2 How do I initiate a prepayment or foreclosure?

1. Contact customer care or visit your servicing branch to request a foreclosure/prepayment statement.
2. The statement will detail the outstanding principal, accrued interest, applicable charges, and the total payable amount.
3. Transfer the payable amount via NEFT/RTGS to the account specified in the statement.
4. Upon receipt and confirmation of payment, Tata Capital will close the loan account (for foreclosure) or adjust the schedule (for part-payment).
5. A No Objection Certificate (NOC) and lien removal letter (for secured loans) will be issued within 30 days of closure.

Our data handling practices comply with the Information Technology Act 2000, RBI KYC/AML guidelines, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) 2023.

### 8.3 Can I have a co-applicant or guarantor?

Yes. For certain products, having a co-applicant (e.g., spouse, parent, sibling) can enhance eligibility and may result in a better interest rate. A guarantor may be required in specific cases where the primary applicant's profile does not fully meet the eligibility criteria. The co-applicant/guarantor's income and credit profile are also assessed during underwriting.

### 8.4 What happens if I miss an EMI payment?

If you miss an EMI payment:

1. A penal interest charge is levied on the overdue amount (up to 2% per month on the unpaid EMI amount).
2. A bounce/dishonour charge of ₹500 per instance + applicable GST may be applied.
3. The default is reported to Credit Information Companies (CICs), which will negatively impact your credit score.
4. Persistent default (3+ consecutive missed EMIs) may result in the account being classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), triggering recovery proceedings.
5. We strongly encourage borrowers facing financial difficulty to contact us proactively to explore restructuring options.
